# User Setup

For reasons of security, if we set up the Calibre-Web container for you, we shall change the default admin password to a randomly-generated string.

We will also create an example reader account, which only allows the user to read books from within the web viewer. We will or have set the username and password as the same for all participating schools so everyone can easily try the digital library.

The credentials are:

Username: `reader`

Password: `Read4life.`
