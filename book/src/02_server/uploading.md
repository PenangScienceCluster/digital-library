# Enabling Uploads

There are many methods to upload books and other media to your Calibre-Web library. Here we will show you the simplest method, which is via the web interface. By default, book uploading is not activated. To begin:

1. In the Admin view, select "Edit Basic Configuration".

1. Open the "Feature Configuration" drop-down.

1. Select "Enable Uploads" and check your reading material fileformat is in the "Allowed Upload Fileformats" option.

Using the admin account, you can immediately upload books with the "Upload" button that will pop up in the menubar at the top. For more fine-tuned options, we suggest creating a librarian account with permissions to upload files while reserving all other administrative options to the admin account.

## Uploading Books

1. If your user has upload privileges, an "Upload" selection will be available in the menu bar. Click to begin.

1. Select a books from your local device to upload to the server.

## Adding Metadata

Calibre-Web can automatically find and add metadata to the uploaded books. There are a few quirks with the process, so here are a few tips to ensure you find your books online.

* Clear out all data except for the title and the first author.
* In the Fetch Metadata dialog box, choose only Amazon and Google if no results show up.

Once you have found a matching book, click on the thumbnail image, and all available fields will be automagically populated. If it looks acceptable, click on "Save".
