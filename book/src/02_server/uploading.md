# Enabling Uploads

There are many methods to upload books and other media to your Calibre-Web library. Here we will show you the simplest method, which is via the web interface. By default, book uploading is not activated. To begin:

1. In the Admin view, select "Edit Basic Configuration".

1. Open the "Feature Configuration" drop-down.

1. Select "Enable Uploads" and check your reading material fileformat is in the "Allowed Upload Fileformats" option.

Using the admin account, you can immediately upload books with the "Upload" button that will pop up in the menubar at the top. For more fine-tuned options, we suggest creating a librarian account with permissions to upload files while reserving all other administrative options to the admin account.
