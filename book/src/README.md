# Introduction

This is a guide to the management and deployment of your digital library using QTS and Calibre. The digital library set consists is a storage server with multiple networking interfaces built in to enable local connections to its WiFi network. When connected to the included 5G modem, or to an active gateway, it also becomes an Internet capable device. The set also includes laptops to connect to the server for content retrieval.

## Hardware

A fully-functional digital library should include all of the following hardware as of May 2023:

* 1 QMiroPlus QNAP server;
* 1 IGE01 5G modem;
* 3 JOI laptops.

## Recommendations

The QMiroPlus (hereafter referred to as the server) runs QTS, a NAS-centric operating system that hosts the software for managing your library. The IGE01 5G modem (hereafter referred to as the modem) provides Internet connectivity when in proximity to a 5G tower. The JOI laptops are to be connected to the network provided by the server to retrieve books from its database, and also to connect to an included Penang Digital Library subscription.

We suggest placing these devices in the school MakerLab to encourage additional tinkering. Makerlab and and computer lab devices can be connected to the QMiroPlus router's WiFI router to access the 5G internet provided by the modem. These devices should be left on 24/7 to allow everyone, especially underprivileged students to use before and after school.

## Support and Service

### Remote support

This digital library project will be supported remotely by being added to a VPN managed by the Penang Science Cluster. A ticket can be raised by emailing us or using the discussion section in our GitHub repository at https://github.com/PenangScienceCluster/qnap-digital-library/discussions.

We encourage you to file bugs at the GitHub repository so we may easily track and triage problems with the hardware and software.

### YTL 5G Subscription
From 2023-05-23 to 2024-05-22, YTL shall provide a sponsored subscription to its 5G service via the IGE01 modem. After the latter date, schools may decide to renew the subscription. Pending further discussion, the subscription may require payment or be renewed for free. Schools have the freedom to switch Internet providers after the end of the service period. Unused modems owned by YTL will be collected from the schools.
