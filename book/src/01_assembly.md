# Assembly

At present, we have identified an issue with connectivity between the server and the modem during initial setup that appears to be based on which devices are turned on first.

We therefore suggest following the steps below in sequence:

1. Take out the IGE01 modem and follow the included instructions to plug in the power and networking cables. Turn on the device. If the illustrated instructions are missing contact support for new copies.

1. Take out the QMiroPlus server and plug in the Ethernet cable from the modem into the Ethernet port labeled "WAN". Note that any router or switch with Internet can be substituted here in case the included modem does not provide sufficient Internet connectivity.

1. Plug in the barrel connector into the server and turn on the device by pushing the power button on the back once. The LEDs will be green when booting up; red if there is no Internet connection; and blue when there is Internet available.

1. The server can be safely shutdown by holding the power button until you hear a long beep. Wait until all the smaller LEDs in the bottom left are off before unplugging the server from the power outlet.

1. The laptops can be treated as standard laptops. Connect them to to router's SSID to start using them with an Internet connection.
